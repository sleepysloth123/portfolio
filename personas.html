                Interfaces, defined as a point of interaction between a user and 
                the object they are using, can be found everywhere – from soda 
                dispensers to web browsers to laundry machines. To analyze what 
                makes an ordinary interface successful or not, I had to step into 
                the shoes of both a user and a UX designer. I observed users 
                interacting with Brown University’s standard washing machines 
                in order to gain a better understanding of how students interact 
                with the machine interface, what users feel and think when interacting 
                with the interface, and how the interface can be improved to enhance 
                the user experiences.

                    Upon observing and interviewing various users interacting with 
                    the washing machines in the basement of my dorm, I came to the 
                    following observations:

            </div>
            <ul><h4>
                <li>Brown washing machines are one of the cheapest and most convenient ways to wash clothes for students </li>
                 <li>   The machines are intuitive and simple to use</li>
                <li>    The holding capacity of each machine is unclear</li>
                <li>    The sticker labels on each machine is helpful, but not very explicit </li>
                <li>    Students must keep track of their own cycle times </li>
                <li>    Once the machine begins, there is no way to end the cycle prematurely</li>
                 <li>    The machine does not seem to be wheelchair accessible</li>
            </h4></ul>

        <div class="container" style="background-color: #9597CA">

                    After gathering my data, I drew up two “personas”, or characters, 
                    that embodied a certain set of traits I observed in each user 
                    that interacted with the machine. Each persona is divided into 
                    Think, Feel, Say, and Do categories, which predict and summarize 
                    their state of being before, during, and after interaction with 
                    the machine.

            </div>
            <h4>
            The first persona is Forgetful Francis, who often forgets small details 
            such as putting in soap before starting the washing machine and setting a
             timer to remind herself when the cycle ends. 
             <br><br>

            <br><br>

            The second persona is Hurried Harold, a student in a rush to prepare 
            for his interview. As a result, he shows more carelessness and 
            aggressiveness when using the laundry machines, highlighting some of 
            the actions that the washing machines allow that may act as a source of 
            distress for students. <br><br>

                    Exploring interfaces and personas allows me to gain more 
                    insight into the user experience impacted by interface design.
                    During this project, I learned how to analyze and summarize 
                    user experiences in order to realize potential issues and solutions 
                    to existing interfaces. Personifying these experiences serves as 
                    a valuable tool when designing my own interfaces, as it encourages 
                    me to consider multiple perspectives and audiences who each have 
                    different opinions and mannerisms that affect the way in which 
                    they interact with an interface.
